# Logistic-Regression
Applied Logistic Regression on Titanic Dataset to predict whether a passenger has survived or not.
We were given a training dataset csv file with X train and Y train data and a x test file and we have to predict and submit predictions for this file.
Predictions were saved in a csv file and the score was calculated depending upon the accuracy.
